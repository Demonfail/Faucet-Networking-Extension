This is the Faucet Networking Extension, a Game Maker extension for easy integration of
networking into Game Maker games. It is distributed under the ISC license, which is short
and simple enough that I don't have to explain it, just read the LICENSE file.


Usage

Currently, the user documentation is located here:

Creating the extension from source

To create the .gex extension file, you need the following steps:
- Compile a .dll from the source code in the faucet directory
- Create the .gex from the .dll


Compiling the .dll

For building the .dll I recommend using MinGW, because that's what I use myself
(version 4.5.0). MSVC should work too, but has not been tested.

This project requires the free Boost library, available from http://www.boost.org

At this time no build script is provided, so start up your favourite IDE and set up
the following rules:
- all .cpp files in the faucet directory and subdirectories should be compiled
  and then linked as a dll.
- As include directories, you need to set up the Boost include dir as well as the project
  directory itself (i.e. the directory containing this file)
- Link statically with the mswsock and ws2_32 libraries, as well as the boost system library
  (I used the mt-s variant). Also, statically link with the multithreading-safe standard library.
  
Please let me know if it worked, I set this up more or less by trial and error myself :P


Creating the .gex

For this task you need the GM Extension Maker, which you can download from
http://www.yoyogames.com/make/extensions . Open the extension description file (faucetnet.ged)
in the main project directory. You'll have to adapt it to work for you, so click on the 
faucetNetworking.dll file and switch to the "Misc" tab. Change the "Original Name" to
the pathname where your own .dll is located.

Now you should be able to build the extension (File->Build Package...)
