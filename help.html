For example, you can&rsquo;t read 2.5 bytes, or connect to port 91.6. In cases where integer values are expected, they are rounded toward zero (truncated) before use, except where otherwise noted.

In general, use a graceful close if you are closing the connection because there is nothing left to send or receive, and use an abortive close if you want to cut off a connection. If the socket is already in error state, then the connection is already closed, so there is no difference between the two functions.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">If the remote end of the connection is still sending data when you close the local socket, his socket will probably receive an error so that he will not be able to read all data that you sent, even when you use a graceful close.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">For acceptors, it doesn&rsquo;t matter which of the functions you use.</span></p><h4 class="c7 c18"><a name="h.kc28ud-wxkl7r"></a><span class="c10">Sending and receiving information</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c4">To understand how sending and receiving work, you first need to know that a socket has two internal buffers: The send buffer and the receive buffer. To send data, you need to add data to the socket&rsquo;s send buffer and then call socket_send(socket). When you receive data, it will be written to the receive buffer.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">To access these buffers, you can use some of the normal buffer functions described in the Buffers section and pass them a socket handle instead of a buffer handle. In general, buffer functions that read data will refer to the receive buffer, and those that write data will refer to the send buffer. However, not all buffer functions make sense for the internal buffers of sockets, so check the descriptions of the individual functions to find out more.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">If you need more flexibility, you can use write_buffer to copy existing normal buffers to the send buffer, or to copy the receive buffer into a normal buffer.</span></p><h6 class="c6"><a name="h.luwz8z-opvuet"></a><span class="c3">tcp_receive(tcpSocket, size) : bool</span></h6><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Try reading </span><span class="c2">size</span><span class="c4"> bytes into the socket&rsquo;s receive buffer. The previous contents of the receive buffer will be discarded. If the requested number of bytes is not available, a receive operation is started in the background to read at least as many bytes as requested, so that calling this function again later can succeed.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Returns true if the operation was successful. The receive buffer now contains exactly the number of bytes requested. If false is returned, the receive buffer will be empty.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">If </span><span class="c2">size</span><span class="c4"> is negative or far too large (&gt;=2</span><span class="c12">32</span><span class="c4">), the function will return false without starting a background read.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">If the connection is closed and more bytes are requested than are remaining to be read, the requested number of bytes can never become available. In this case the socket will transition to an error state.</span></p><h6 class="c6"><a name="h.q0zjhy-p3pk5w"></a><span class="c3">tcp_receive_available(tcpSocket) : size</span></h6><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Read all data currently available from the socket into the socket&rsquo;s receive buffer. The previous contents of the receive buffer will be discarded. The function returns the number of bytes read, which is the same as the new size of the receive buffer.</span></p><h6 class="c6"><a name="h.9f44dad5wc6q"></a><span class="c3">tcp_eof(socket) : bool</span></h6><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Determine if there is no more data to receive. This means that the connection is closed in the receiving direction, either because the sender has closed it or because of an error, and all internally buffered data has been received (though there might still be unread data in the receive buffer). In that case, attempting to receive any more data on this socket will cause the socket to report an error.</span></p><h6 class="c6"><a name="h.4f4ey3-wu0a8u"></a><span class="c3">socket_send(socket) : void</span></h6><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Try to send data from the internal sendbuffer out through the socket. If you call this function too often, it might result in many small TCP packets being sent, which causes a lot of overhead and thus needs more bandwidth. If you call it too seldom, the data will sit in the sendbuffer for a longer time before being sent, so you get larger delays. A good time to call this is right after you&rsquo;re done writing things to the sendbuffer of this socket for this step.</span></p><h6 class="c6"><a name="h.aaq79f-lq7dpf"></a><span class="c3">socket_sendbuffer_size(socket) : size</span></h6><p class="c5"><span class="c4">How many bytes are in the sendbuffer?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">If the connection can&rsquo;t send data as fast as the application demands, the sendbuffer will grow. This function can be used to detect slow connections and reduce the data rate. However, the result should be taken with a large grain of salt. The number returned does not include data already queued for sending in the network layer, and this can be a lot of data (in the order of megabytes). If you send data in many small chunks though, there should be less of that queued data and you should see a growing backlog in the sendbuffer pretty quickly.</span></p><h6 class="c6"><a name="h.awda18-j52u5z"></a><span class="c3">socket_receivebuffer_size(socket) : size</span></h6><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Returns the ammount of data in the receive buffer, analogous to buffer_size for normal buffers. The reason why this is a seperate function is to avoid confusion, because buffer_size(socket) doesn&rsquo;t make clear whether the send or receive buffer is meant, and the function would make sense for both.</span></p><h6 class="c6"><a name="h.a3co14-xfxbjr"></a><span class="c3">socket_sendbuffer_limit(socket, size) : void</span></h6><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Prevent the sendbuffer from growing larger than this value (in bytes). 0 means no limit. If the sendbuffer would exceed this capacity the connection will be closed and an appropriate error will be indicated. There is no default limit since a reasonable value depends heavily on the application. To prevent &ldquo;out of memory&rdquo; problems it is recommended to set this limit on every socket.</span></p><h6 class="c6"><a name="h.8fpuu2hj0ymo"></a><span class="c3">udp_send(buffer, host, port) : void</span></h6><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Warning: This function has been included for preliminary UDP support, to make it possible to port Gang Garrison 2 to this library.

For data types that consist of several bytes (e.g. int), that creates the question in which order they are transmitted. Most networking applications use the big-endian format, where the most significant byte of an integer is sent first (we&rsquo;ll get to floating point values further below.) This is also the default byte order for this extension. However, some applications use the little-endian format where the bytes are sent in the opposite order. Perhaps most important in the context of GM networking, 39dll uses little-endian. In order to support both formats, the functions in this chapter were introduced.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">In this library, endianness is an attribute of buffers and sockets. Whenever you write a value to a buffer or socket, it will be converted to a sequence of bytes using the endianness set for this target. The endianness also determines how values are read. Buffers and strings are already sequences of bytes, so writing those is not affected by the endianness of the target.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">The previous sentence is pretty important, so let&rsquo;s consider what it means in practice: Setting a socket to little-endian does </span><span class="c2">not</span><span class="c4"> ensure everything sent or received through it will be little-endian - only values written/read </span><span class="c2">directly</span><span class="c4"> to/from the socket&rsquo;s send and receive buffer will be converted. If you write your values to a big-endian buffer first and then write that to the little-endian socket, the data will still be sent as big-endian.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Another important point is about floating point values. First off, these are converted to the requested endianness as well. However, there are more uncertainties with floats and doubles than just the byte order, because they can have different formats on different kinds of computers, and there is no single exact standard that everyone uses. This library sends them in the native format used by x86 PCs, and you will not run into problems as long as you communicate with games on other PCs which also use this library. However, if you want to communicate with different software or different kinds of computers, using float and double might give you unexpected results.</span></p><h6 class="c6"><a name="h.bz9gcq-r4c8qc"></a><span class="c3">set_little_endian_global(bool) : void</span></h6><p class="c5"><span class="c4">If the parameter is true, all new buffers and sockets are created with little-endian byte order, if it is false they will use big-endian.
