This branch contains special functions for gg2 that will either become obsolete in the future
(e.g. file access, once we have shared buffers) or will be added as part of the main branch
of Faucet Netowrking. Currently, the following additional functions exist:

append_file_to_buffer(buffer, filename) : errorcode
Appends the content of the given file to the buffer. Returns 1 on success, or a
negative error code on failure.

write_buffer_to_file(buffer, filename) : errorcode
Overwrites/creates the file with the provided name and writes the entire buffer
content to this file. Returns 1 on success, a negative number on failure.
